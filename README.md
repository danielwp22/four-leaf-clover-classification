This project is an AI-based image classifier designed to distinguish between 3-leaf and 4-leaf white clovers using a deep learning model (ResNet18). It leverages a self-collected dataset of over 100 clover images and employs data augmentation to improve model performance.

Features
Preprocessing pipeline with normalization and data augmentation.
Deep learning model trained using ResNet18 on PyTorch.
Achieved 80% validation accuracy on the dataset.

Tech Stack
Python
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib

Results
The model achieved 80% validation accuracy after applying data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.

Future Improvements
Increase dataset size for better generalization.
Experiment with other architectures like EfficientNet.
